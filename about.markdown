## me

I'm a senior software engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com), living and
working in Portland, Oregon. Although I mainly write Go and Ruby professionally,
I was a full-time [Clojure] developer for several years. Outside of work, I tend to
focus on statically-typed, purely functional languages like [Haskell], [Idris],
and [Elm]. In 2016, I co-authored a book called [Professional Clojure][].

I'm unapologetically passionate about social justice. I affirm the fundamental
rights and equality of all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, sexuality,
disability, gender identity/expression, religion, or socio-economic status. I
proudly and unequivocally affirm that black lives matter.

## the blog

This blog is rendered using [Hakyll], with a few extras and modifications thrown in:

* The **theme** is based on `hakyll.org`, which you can preview and/or borrow from
  [Katy Chuang's Hakyll CSS Garden][Hakyll CSS Garden].
* The **number tags** (e.g., {{1}}, {{2}}, {{3}}) are thanks to some modifications I
  made to Hakyll. I insert them by adding `{{n}}` anywhere in a document, where
  `n` is a number from 0 to 20.
* **Syntax highlighting** comes from [highlight.js], using a modified version of the
  Monokai theme that matches the one I use in Spacemacs as much as possible.
* The complete **source code** is available on [GitHub].
