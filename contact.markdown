My preferred social network these days is <a rel="me" href="https://tiny.tilde.website/@postpunkjustin">Mastodon</a>.
You can also reach me on Twitter (as long as that still exists) [\@postpunkjustin][twitter], or via [email]. You can
also see my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/juxtin) if you're into that sort of thing.

Job offers/recruiter inquiries are fine, provided they don't require me to
relocate away from Portland, Oregon. That said, I'm not really looking to change
jobs right now.
